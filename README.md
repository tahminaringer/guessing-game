# About Me Guessing Game

I built a web page that asks for the user's name, prompts them through a series of yes or no questions. From there it asks the user if they would like to play a game. If answered no then the the prompts end and it shows the webpage. If yes, My game prompts the user to guess a number between 1-50. If the user answers the correct number the get an alert congratulating them and they move on to the next game. If the user guess incorrect they have trys to get the answer right, if all fail, they move on to the next game. The final game is a game asking what is one of my favorite things. If user guesses correct or incorrect they are given all answers to the game. The final alert tells the user how many questions they got right total.
